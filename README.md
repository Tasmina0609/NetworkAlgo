# Networking Algorithms

Intro to Graph Theory
  Manipulation and study of NetworkX library in Python
 
Dataset available in "cities in az.csv"(sample of cities)  and "airports.csv"(sample of flights) 


Objective of NetworkGraph_PW1_.ipynb

    - Using both datasets plot the graph 
    
    - Create a function to find any path from a given origin to a given destiny (not necessarily optimal)
    
    - Determine the cost of the achieved path.
    
    
   
  
Objective of  NetworkGraph_PW2_.ipynb

     - Applying shortest path to retrieve without weight and then with weight
     
   
Objective of  Network_Project
    
     - Finding the shortest path between airports by applying several algorithms(Dijkstra,BFS,MST-Kruskal's algo,e.t.c)
