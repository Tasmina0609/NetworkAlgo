# Networking Algorithms

Intro to Graph Theory
  Manipulation and study of NetworkX library in Python
 
Dataset available in "cities in az.csv"(sample of cities)  and "airports.csv"(sample of flights) 

Objective:

    - Using both datasets plot the graph 
    
    - Create a function to find any path from a given origin to a given destiny (not necessarily optimal)
    
    - Determine the cost of the achieved path.
